# SmartTraffic Multimodal AI

> **An Intelligent Urban Traffic Optimization System Powered by Multimodal AI and Reinforcement Learning**

---

## üö¶ Project Overview

SmartTraffic Multimodal AI is an advanced smart city solution that leverages multimodal data and cutting-edge AI techniques to optimize urban traffic flow in real time. By integrating traffic camera images, GPS trajectories, weather data, and social media feeds, the system dynamically adjusts traffic signals, predicts congestion, and recommends optimal routes to minimize travel time and reduce emissions.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multimodal Data Fusion:** Integrates real-time data from cameras, GPS, IoT sensors, and weather APIs.
- **Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning:** Decentralized AI agents collaboratively optimize traffic signals using Fed-PPO.
- **Graph Neural Network Prediction:** Models the entire urban road network for accurate, city-scale traffic flow forecasting.
- **Real-Time Dashboard:** Visualizes traffic status, congestion alerts, and system performance with Streamlit and React.
- **Environmental Impact Analysis:** Quantifies emission reductions and energy savings from optimized traffic management.
- **Cloud Native Deployment:** Supports scalable deployment with Docker and Kubernetes.
